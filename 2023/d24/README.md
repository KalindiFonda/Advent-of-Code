#### Thinking process

This one was a lot of reading both trying to find random articles that would help with the understanding and then also strategies people used to solve these 2.




For Part 1 I followed the Wikipedia article on 2 line intersection. Some lines were parallel, some met in the past, never to be reunited and some were yet to meet. If the meeting point was between the window of intersection, that line was to be counted.

And for part 2 I went through the route of trying to implement some of the strategies people explained. I tried quite a few with different levels of success. If I rely heavily on other people's ideas, I still try to implement as much as possible on my own. So sometimes there is a point where I don't really understand what's going on and what should be the next step, so then I move on, to some more readin, either of the theory behind it, or other people's ideas.

Then I found https://reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/18q40he/2023_day_24_part_2_a_straightforward_nonsolver
I actually did all the steps on paper. Moving the various parts of the equations to the different parts of the equal sign. I don't know when was the last time I moved things around in equations by hand, so that was fun. 

Follwoing the above I extracted the various values, and printed out a few of the equations for my lines. Than I used those values with wolfram alpha to solve the equation https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=system+equation+calculator&assumption=%7B%22F%22%2C+%22SolveSystemOf4EquationsCalculator

There are some comments in the "code" as well. Better read the reddit posts, mine is more a keepsake of the 2023 star-rewarded AoC struggles.
