# Wohooo lets go


## 1st - A disclaimer: 

Beware, code written in 6am conditions full of sleepy and stressure.
Before posting I remove print statements, unused variables, and dead-end functions and tries, otherwise I leave the code as is, because I think it's fun to see what happens under those conditions.

For each day's implementation check those READMEs.


#### Learning goals

[This is definitely not happening yet] 

One of the things I'll try to add this year, is some form of testing. 
So, far it hasn't been really useful (used it only in asserting that the test data value is correct, and then if so it continues with the actual data - from day 2) but I imagine it might be interesting to try it out when I get stuck. 

[and yes there wasn't much of it, except for running the code on the input data once it correctly identified the value for the test data.]

#### Some great quotes: 

##### On the beauty of AoC code

On the topic of many for loops I had a conversation where my chat-partner mentioned this: 

```
If I didn't want to finish this morning as fast as possible i would defiantly have looked at that if chain and said this isn't right. Well I mean I did look at it and think that but then a louder voice screamed "no time for that now!".
```

##### While checking if the brute force solution could work

```
[Person A]
More than 10 mins runtime and 400 million steps seem not enough for part 2. Am I doing something wrong? I do not want to check the spoiler channels just yet

[Person B]
You are at 0.00254% of my answer 😅

[Person A]
ouch 🤯

```

##### (Nearying to the) End

I couldn't do day 21 part 2 in the morning, I gave up without even trying, I was too tired and had other things to do (for example do the remaining 150km by bike to get to 3000km in 2023 🚴‍♀️) so I figured I'll do it in the evening. But the evening tired brain is even worse than morning tired brain, and despite having enough adrenaline to take me through the night, when it hit 6am without bagging all the stars of the day and no way I could focus on the next, so I announced (temporary) defeat.

I went to sleep and then a few hours later got on the bike. Sometimes we chase stars sometimes we chase kms. I am always impressed how exhausting AoC is. Like even on days when I spend less then an hour. 

It took me a few days to recover, and I was done with a few 2023 days to spare.

#### times

It's interesting to compare these year on year. I take the global ranking might reflect my coding skills, maybe???

### Thank yous

To the Le Wagon crew that makes this a worldwide community event, to all the people that joined in on the chatter on Slack, to the Brussels crew and my 1109 squad. Sometimes you stumble upon a community, and you become part of it, and they become part of you.



#### And it's done!

Some days I was like oh my don't even think of signing up for this next year, but i'ts 2 weeks later and I already can't wait. 

There are many more stars I can chase before next December, even maybe the 50th of a few years, but I'll take a bit of a break now, and chase real stars in the middle of the ocean.
