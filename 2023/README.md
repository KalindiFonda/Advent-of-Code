## 1st - A disclaimer: 

Beware, code written in 6am conditions full of sleepy and stressure.
Before posting I remove print statements, unused variables, and dead-end functions and tries, otherwise I leave the code as is, because I think it's fun to see what happens under those conditions.

For each day's implementation check those READMEs.


#### times

It's interesting to compare these year on year. I take the global ranking might reflect my coding skills, maybe???

```
      -------Part 1--------   -------Part 2--------
Day       Time  Rank  Score       Time  Rank  Score
  5   00:33:20  3598      0   02:14:22  4928      0
  4   00:08:08  2172      0   00:17:24  1655      0
  3   00:29:39  3048      0   00:43:19  2772      0
  2   00:14:06  2572      0   00:20:17  2923      0
  1   00:04:27  1680      0   00:13:32   805      0
  ```


#### Learning goals

One of the things I'll try to add this year, is some form of testing. 
So, far it hasn't been really useful (used it only in asserting that the test data value is correct, and then if so it continues with the actual data - from day 2) but I imagine it might be interesting to try it out when I get stuck.
