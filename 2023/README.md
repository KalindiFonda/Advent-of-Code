# Wohooo lets go



One of the things I'll try to add this year, is some form of testing. 
So, far it hasn't been really useful (used it only in asserting that the test data value is correct, and then if so it continues with the actual data - from day 2) but I imagine it might be interesting to try it out when I get stuck.
