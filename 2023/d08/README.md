[ðŸŒŸ Day 8 ðŸŒŸ](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/8)


#### Thinking process

Fun one again! 
Part 1 was swift, part 2 took a solid fiddle to figure out to do. 

Part 1, I created a dictionary with the left/right nodes, and then travelled down the dictionary, until I found the node I wanted.

Part 2 was a journey. Of course I tried the above, but one window was running that while I was trying to figure out alternative solutions, and there was no sign of result. 
Then I figured I could maybe find the points when the various start points get to a Z value, and then find matching values [lots of fiddling here]. But at some point when I printed them out, I was like hmmmm, they 1. seem related to the result, 2. end and start arrival "stations" were also related, which is still a bit confusing. But then I did the lowest common multiplier and that was that.


#### Issues

I think I am in a "sweet" spot where I know there are some algo and datastructure solutions, so I go all in in trying to remember, figure out and then implement something. 

When in fact there might be a simpler/logical/how-would-a-human do it solution sometimes, which I miss because I go all into the "what was that thing already". ðŸ˜‚

It's that equivalent to the learning how to dance story. Like first you dance without thinking and knowing anything so you do whatever, flail your arms, to the rythm or not, yea! Then you learn some moves, and because you focus on the steps and think of the coregraphy and whatever it's more likely one trips up on ones own legs. But then (supposedly) mastery (of the new level) comes and the let go / play / ease / natural-ness comes again.

It's nice to see, though, how maybe something where I stumbled or had to figure out years ago, is now part of my dance routine.

You know:

#### Things I thought about afterwards:
