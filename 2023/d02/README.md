[ðŸŒŸ Day 2 ðŸŒŸ](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/2)


Today was the first time where my thinking about "testing" was a bit useful. So far this meant that if I get it right for the test data, it goes on to try it on the actual data by itself, without me needing to fiddle around with 


#### Thinking process

This part was mostly about parsing. 
And I used dictionaries to keep track of how many cubes there can be or were already in use. 


####Â Things I thought about afterwards:

I usually try to keep data reading separate from the computation, but this one was easy enough.
