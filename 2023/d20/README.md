[ðŸŒŸ Day 20 ðŸŒŸ](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/20)

Advent of (reading)Comprehension is back ðŸ« 
This took quite an effort to read through ðŸ¤£ but eventually this was the takeaway:

![how do % and & turn things to hi or low pulse](how_things_work.png)

Also happy ðŸŽ‚ to my mum! 


#### Thinking process


Part 1: 

Was a translation of the above rules into code. And running it 1000 times while keeping a counter of low and high pulses.



Part 2: 

I was hopeful, but not that hopeful:
```
how long did you wait for your part 2s ðŸ¤£
Is it forever?
```


I felt that there was definitely some inspiration to get from the way the data was built, so I tried to visualize it [in a jupyter notebook](graph_out_of_dictionary.ipynb), I think my first iteration had one big blob but maybe by using different libraries or something, eventually I could see the 4 blobs.

![one can kinda see the 4 incoming and outgoing blobs](visualisation_of_4_groups.png)

Or you lnow, one can make it pretty like this too:

My thinking as I tried to come to a solution (that I then successfully implemented):

There are 4 separate sections of cycles, each getting one input pulse with one output pulse (going to rx through one node). If i understand what the 4 nodes leading to rx need, then I can check when each of the cycles matches the needed output and then do lcm of the values like a few days ago.

Like so:
