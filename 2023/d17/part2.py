# Beware, code written in 6am conditions full of sleepy and stressure.
# Before posting I remove print statements, unused variables, and dead-end functions and tries, otherwise I leave the code as is, because I think it's fun to see what happens under those conditions.
# For more info read the READMEs.

#Â Ahahaha, I had to delete so many print statements, that I barely feel like it's the same code haha
