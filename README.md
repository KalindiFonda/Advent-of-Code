The joy is here!!!!


Here is my github repo finally. 
I'll start with recent stuff, and see if I can add some from way back. I am one of the ones who wakes up, so the code is always in a rush, and further into December also tired. 
I'll try to leave it as is (as in not clean it up before commiting it here), I feel that's the magic of AOC, anything goes as long as it goes. 
If I'll notice some interesting code bits/processes from other people or with time I'll add them into the readmes. 

Still need to see how this will work.




I actually do a fair few of the exercises on repl.it, maybe because they are always there no matter what computer I am on, but maybe because I am still scared of infinite loops. I feel like I sometimes move to my computer as the weeks progress.

It's always a battle between trying to do it fast, and stopping for a moment to make a plan. Or being stuck and pushing or taking a step back and re-evaluate.


### AoC and me

#### 2020
2020 was my frist year and I got so increadibly hooked. I managed to actually get all the 50, I think I spent about 20 hours straight on one of the exercises, because I thought you don't get stars if you don't do them before the last one is released  🤣 
(5am uk)

As days go, it becomes harder and harder to wake up, to keep the tempo especially with the competing December events (like family and holiday parties and even in 2020, zoom hangouts of all sorts).

#### 2021

2021 I was sick getting into December, but I still kept waking up at 5am, thinking I could maybe wing it. Then I went for an underwater rugby tournament (and the party afterwards), so even more exhaustion and lack of sleep, and cold water all they long, I still kept waking up. Anyways I wasn't getting better, it's not just the disease it's the adrenaline of these stars, at some point when half of my lip had sores, feverish and all I was like ok maybe I should actually sleep. 


#### 2022 

2022 I was working with LAMAVE in the Philiphines and the tasks were coming out in the middle of the day, and it was hard to do them if we were out on the boat, I did actually do a few of the first days on my phone on the way back from research, sun, sea, reflection, all perfect for phone coding. Anyways day 10 or so, my computer just died. It was like, I am done. It woke up a few day days later, but the momentum was gone (plus I had to catch up on all the other things I wasn't able to do with my dead computer - the computer I use to this day, so I really don't know what happened).


### 2023

I am at 6am in 2023, and I miss the 5am starts, as there is more time before the world wakes up and starts asking for things!
I think, this is a pretty good deal. Helps me have good sleeping habits by giving me a reason to go to bed earlier. Not that I go necessarily, but I have a reason to, he he.

Let's see how far I get this year. AoC is something that makes me joyous, and I am grateful for the crew that makes it happen. 

And this year, I am part of the Le Wagon AoC party and hype, and it's lovely to have a community to be excited about it together, wohooo.
